# YouTube-Views

## Problem Statement
- ABC company want to target geographical ads based on YouTube information to decrease their Cost-to-Acquire New customer up to 10% monthly for the coming month. 

## Dataset
- CSV file 

## EDA
- Tableau 
- Python Notebook

## Ideation
- Understand the YouTube content creatorsâ€™ channels target audience behaviour to team up with them for Ads advertising.
- Define the metrics for performance (DAU,MAU,Cost-To-Acquire New customer, Satisfaction score, Net promoter score) etc.
- Do your own homework (Understand the domain keywords like performance metrics)
- Start doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the below types (Best build dashboard to achieve best visibility)
  - Deviation
  - Correlation
  - Ranking 
  - Distribution
  - Change Over Time
  - Waterfall
  - Spatial 
- Build and train base line model Linear Regression
- To improve ML model performance train the data with Random Forest Regressor. 
- RMSE error is the ML model performance indicator.

## After Ideation
- Check with domain expertise person to further train the ML model using location to sperate the main model.
- After getting reasonable ML metric value we need to start testing using Statistics (A/B).
- Before A/B testing select random samples from location based data and conduct z-test to avoid selection bias.
- Define Null and Alternative hypothesis framing with default action.
- P value = 0.05 
- If P value > 0.05 then accept null hypothesis. Else accept Alternative hypothesis.
